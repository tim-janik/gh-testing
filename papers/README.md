> Abstract: In this paper, we propose a physical model of the hi-hat. Two cymbals are modeled with
> thin spherical shells, into which a point mass resembling a stick collides. Two models are proposed for
> the collision of two cymbals: a spring model and an algorithmically mimicked inelastic collision
> model. The governing equations for the two proposed models are derived, discretized using the ﬁnite
> diﬀerence method, and analyzed numerically. Several numerical experiments have revealed the
> validity of the two proposed models and the characteristics of the hi-hat.
